# predictive-analytics
## ðŸš€ Overview
This project leverages predictive analytics and machine learning to optimize resource scaling in DevOps environments. By forecasting system metrics (like CPU, memory, and traffic), the system can proactively scale cloud infrastructure, reduce costs, and improve performance and reliability.

## ðŸ§  Motivation
Traditional auto-scaling reacts to metrics after thresholds are breached, often leading to latency or outages. This project aims to predict resource needs ahead of time and automate scaling decisions using those forecastsâ€”bringing intelligence into infrastructure management.



## Tool/Framework
Prometheus, CloudWatch
InfluxDB, TimescaleDB
Python (pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Prophet)
Jenkins, GitLab CI, ArgoCD
Kubernetes, Terraform, AWS ASG
Grafana, Kibana
